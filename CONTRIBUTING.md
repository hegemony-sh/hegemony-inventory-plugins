This repository is part of the Hegemony project. Its source is licensed under
`AGPL-3.0-or-later`. Your contribution is licensed under the same terms, and
contributing it transfers no copyright to the project. There is no Contributor
License Agreement.

Every commit must be signed off under the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO),
version 1.1. A `Signed-off-by:` line certifies that you wrote the change, or
otherwise have the right to submit it under the project licence. Sign off with
`git commit -s`. The DCO GitHub App checks every commit in a pull request: the
sign-off's name and email must match the commit's author. Merge
commits and commits by GitHub bot accounts are skipped. To add a missing
sign-off to every commit on your branch, run
`git rebase --signoff origin/main` and force-push the branch.

A commit written by an AI coding agent is signed off by the person who directs
the agent and submits the work, as its author; the agent is credited in a
`Co-authored-by:` trailer and never signs off in its own name. See the
platform's
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hegemony-sh/hegemony/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#licensing-and-dco).

## Releasing

A merge to `main` is a release. The `Release` workflow calls the shared
[`plugin-release.yml`](https://github.com/hegemony-sh/hegemony-workflows)
workflow, which runs [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/):
it reads the Conventional Commits since the last tag, derives the next
version from them, bumps every package and SDK pin (`scripts/set_version.py`),
refreshes `uv.lock`, builds and smoke-installs the wheels, prepends
`CHANGELOG.md`, commits `chore(release): X.Y.Z [skip ci]`, tags `vX.Y.Z` and
publishes the wheels plus `SHA256SUMS` as the GitHub Release. There is no
manual step any more: do not bump versions or push `v*` tags by hand.

| Commits since the last tag | Release |
|---|---|
| `fix`, `perf`, `revert` | patch |
| `feat` | minor |
| breaking change (`feat!:`, `fix!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) | **minor, while the major is 0** |
| `chore`, `docs`, `ci`, `test`, `refactor`, `build`, `style` | none |

The 0.x rule is the `"breaking": true` entry in `.releaserc.json`'s
`releaseRules`; once the packages reach 1.0, change its `release` to
`major`. Deleting it is not enough: the rules are tried in order and the
first match wins, so a breaking `feat` would still match the `feat` rule and
release a minor.

Releases are immutable. The pipeline refuses to run when a GitHub Release for
the next tag already exists and never replaces published assets: fix forward
with a new commit, which becomes the next release. Attestations are created
only for public repositories, so releases cut while this repository is
private ship checksums only.

One failure a re-run cannot repair: semantic-release pushes the release
commit and the `vX.Y.Z` tag before it publishes the GitHub Release, so if
publication fails after that push the tag exists without a Release, and the
next run reads the tag as the last release. Publish that tag's assets by hand
from a checkout of the tag, as the shared workflow's
[README](https://github.com/hegemony-sh/hegemony-workflows#recovering-a-tag-without-a-release)
describes (`gh release create vX.Y.Z --verify-tag ... dist/*.whl
dist/SHA256SUMS` after rebuilding the wheels at that tag).

The shared workflow is pinned by commit in `.github/workflows/release.yml`;
a change merged to it reaches this repository through a pull request that
bumps that SHA.
